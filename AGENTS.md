# Agents Configuration

This file contains project-specific guidelines for agents (e.g., Codex CLI).

- **Always use `pnpm`** for installing dependencies, running scripts, and managing packages in this repository.
- **Always update** this and any other `AGENTS.md` files when there is a relevant change to dependencies, scripts, or project configuration.
