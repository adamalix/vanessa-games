## Planning Guidelines

When creating new plans:

1. **Create descriptive filenames** that indicate the feature/area being planned
2. **Include status tracking** with clear completion criteria
3. **Break down into phases and tasks** for manageable implementation
4. **Document dependencies** between tasks and external requirements
5. **Update status regularly** as work progresses
6. **Archive completed plans** here with summary of achievements

## Active Planning Process

For in-progress plans:

- Keep them in the root directory while active
- Move to `planning/` when completed
- Update README.md with status and achievements
- Include links to related PRs and implementation details
